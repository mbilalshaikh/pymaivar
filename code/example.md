# Documentation for the example.py

This script is designed to process .wav audio files, generating a range of audio features including waveforms, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, and chroma features. The script uses a variety of modules, including `core` (a module presumably containing core processing functions), `myutils` (a utility module), and `glob` (a standard Python library for file manipulation).

The script is structured to be executed as a standalone program.

## Dependencies

- **core**: This custom module should contain all the feature generation functions like `gen_sc`, `gen_waveplot`, `gen_mfcc`, `gen_mfccs`, `gen_spec1`, `gen_spec2`, `gen_specrf`, and `gen_chrom`. These functions are expected to take audio file path as an input parameter.
  
- **myutils**: This module should have a function `loadAudio` that is expected to load an audio file and return the audio data `x` and its sample rate `sr`.
  
- **glob**: A built-in Python module for generating lists of files matching given patterns.

## Execution

When run, the script executes the following steps:

1. Lists all `.wav` files in the "../data" directory.

2. Loads the first audio file in the list into memory using the `myutils.loadAudio()` function, which is expected to return the audio data `x` and its sample rate `sr`.

3. Calls multiple functions from the `core` module with the first audio file as an argument. Each of these functions is presumably designed to generate a specific audio feature or representation:

   - `gen_sc(audio)`: Generates spectral contrast.
   
   - `gen_waveplot(audio)`: Generates a waveplot of the audio.
   
   - `gen_mfcc(audio)`: Generates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of the audio.
   
   - `gen_mfccs(audio)`: Possibly generates multiple MFCCs or a series of MFCCs of the audio.
   
   - `gen_spec1(audio)`, `gen_spec2(audio)`, `gen_specrf(audio)`: Generate three different types of spectrograms of the audio. The specifics of what each type of spectrogram represents is not given in the provided code.
   
   - `gen_chrom(audio)`: Generates Chroma features of the audio.


## Note
Since the provided script does not include error handling or checks for the presence and validity of audio files, it might fail if, for example, no `.wav` files are found in the specified directory, or if an error occurs during audio processing.

Moreover, the script only processes the first audio file it finds. If you need to process multiple files, you would need to iterate over all files in `audio_files`.
